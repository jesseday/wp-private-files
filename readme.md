# Wordpress private files plugin

Allow wordpress editors and administrator to mark files as private after uploading.

### Caveats
 
* This relies on the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin.
* Currently, this also depends on there being a `/private/` directory within your uploads directory that is protected.  This plugin was developed
for a site hosted on Pantheon, which provides this feature.  Read more [here](https://pantheon.io/docs/private-paths/).
